Case Study
ClubSpot

A space dedicated to connecting and informing students about the events, clubs, and organizations on their campus 


The Problem

Social media, it is the main stream of communication for the generation of today: dating, events, jobs, and everything else. There is no standard social media app for clubs, organizations, or campus involvement for college students. 

The problem that “ClubSpot” directly solves is the issue of lost information about the hundreds of clubs, both locally or nationally, on a college campus. Each university has a different way of going about club/organization engagement whether it be social media, a physical club fair, etc. 

“ClubSpot” is a hub for all clubs/events/teams, creating a seamless experience for signing up for a club, keeping up with all of them, and attending events whether or not the individual is directly involved. This app is made to foster connection—through the organizations at one’s university. 


Users & Audience 

The user/audience for this app is anyone enrolled in a university or has a college education email. 


Team & Role

This app is not yet created. However, I hope to build this app with a core team of a few designers and software developers. I would coordinate facets of design including: user task flow, visual aesthetics, product management, and prototyping. 

I would conduct user research through organizing an experimentation focus group of my friends, who are all very active experienced online shoppers. 

Design Process

The design process thus far has been just myself flowing through the vision I have for the app. I have had a few target users look at the design but have not yet received enough constructive criticism to incorporate into the prototype. 

Below is a map of the current user flow. A test that would be helpful to find the most ideal user flow would be through experimentation and surveying users, to better understand their individual ideal flows.


User Interface

Condensing events, applying, list of clubs, messaging, etc, into one epicenter for extracurriculars has many positive effects including: more engagement, equal marketing and opportunity for students to get involved. 


The login page where any student can sign in using just their school email, no intense detailed sign up required
The tab list is the navigation for the app, allowing the user to seamlessly flow through the many features
This is the splash homepage, it hosts upcoming events for the user, uses AI pulling from messages and announcements to create a to do list for the user, in addition to the user creating their own tasks manually



Announcements for anything can get jumbled between categories. The app separates each clubs announcements as well as a large all encompassing tab. An unread tab is available as well to make sure the user doesn’t miss anything important. 
This is the calendar page for the user to see all their club events or saved events from other clubs in one place.
This is a condensed page of all notifications places on high alert from the club admin that posts it. Whether it be a text or announcement, both places on high alert will become a notification and can be seen here. 



Messages for all clubs a user is involved in can be found here. That way personal (groupme, texting, etc) communication and club communication are separated. This is a feature I’ve added based on expressed user interest. 
This page is to send feedback or help to the app customer service if there are bugs or issues with a user’s account.
The user can change/add/remove a profile picture and password etc. Typical setting page.

This is the KEY page and mission of the app. Searching for clubs easily as well as finding an updated list of all of them in every category.
This is what the list of ALL clubs would look like. For browsing purposes, like a catalog. 
There are lots of features here. The top uses a users interests and recommends clubs for them, deadlines for all clubs regardless of if the user is interested or not are shown just in case. Lastly, if given permission, the app can link to contacts in user’s phone and show what their friends have been signing up for.
