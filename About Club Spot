Case Study
ClubSpot

A space dedicated to connecting and informing students about the events, clubs, and organizations on their campus 


The Problem

Social media, it is the main stream of communication for the generation of today: dating, events, jobs, and everything else. There is no standard social media app for clubs, organizations, or campus involvement for college students. 

The problem that “ClubSpot” directly solves is the issue of lost information about the hundreds of clubs, both locally or nationally, on a college campus. Each university has a different way of going about club/organization engagement whether it be social media, a physical club fair, etc. 

“ClubSpot” is a hub for all clubs/events/teams, creating a seamless experience for signing up for a club, keeping up with all of them, and attending events whether or not the individual is directly involved. This app is made to foster connection—through the organizations at one’s university. 


Users & Audience 

The user/audience for this app is anyone enrolled in a university or has a college education email.
